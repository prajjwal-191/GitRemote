git init -b main
now write some text/code and if you want add some more files 
now stage it by doing git add .
commit by saying git commit -m "version 1"

do one more update and stage it and commit it as "version 2"

also include .gitignore file and put creds.txt inside it
now go to github create one remote repo and copy its https url

in command line and in your local repo directory configure your username 
git config --global credential.username "prajjwal191"

now link your local repo with remote repo (give some nickname to remote repo such as origin)
git add origin https url you copied 

you can confirm that it is linked or not
git remote  / git remote -v

now push commit to github
git push origin main
and give password to authenticate

now your local repo is also present at remote location that is github

now if you update local repo and changed something and stage && commit then it will not be in remote repo so again push
git push origin main
if you want to push it as previous commit by using --amend
git commit -m "Remote version 1" --amend
if you try to push it to git it will give warnings that you are amending hence it will overwrite on previous commit so do
git push origin main -f (f stands for pushing forcely)

and this is how you can create one remote repo
