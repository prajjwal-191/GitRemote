if we have a github repo (remote repo) and we want to save it locally and make it a local git repo then
go to github and go to root of that repo and go in code section and copy https url
now come to command line and change directory where you want to save this clone repo and then give command
git clone copy_https_url give_name_of_repo(if you will not give name then it will save  it with same name as in remote repo)
so now you have clone of your github repo locally
