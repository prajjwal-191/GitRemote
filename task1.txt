if we have one local repo and its remote repo suppose so we want to update the remote repo and then we want the remote change to be reflected in our local repo

clone the remote repo at any local directory 
git clone copy_https_url of remote repo give_name_of_repo
now in cloned file do desired changes and stage and commit it 
also push this code 
git push origin main

so this clone is pushed and hence our remote repo is updated 

now come back again to our original local repo direcory

now we want this update to be reflected in original local repo 
but if we do git log we can see our local repo is having head/branch_name/ remote_tracking_branch at previous commit only
this happened because remote_tracking_branch do not update automaticallly
so to update remote_tracking_branch do
git fetch

now if you do git log --all then we can see remote_tracking_branch points to a commit ahead to local branch 
so in order to sync it the local branch should point to commit poointed by remote_tracking_branch 
and do this use command
git pull origin main

now all the updates are synced
